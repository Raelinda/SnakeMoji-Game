## SnakeMoji!
I created this snake game based on the code I learned in Scrimba's Front End Developer Path, Module 4: css and JavaScript fundamentals.

The code we were taught was mainly JavaScript, which just enough HTML & css to make the game functional.

Our assignment was to add styling to the game and make it uniquely our own.

I chose a design that would increase positivity. Instead of the snake chasing after fruit, it chases emojis. The first emoji to appear on the gameboard is very sad looking. But every time the snake catches an emoji, the next emoji to appear on the board is a happier emoji. The longer you play, the happier the emoji.

The rainbow image I used for the background came from here: https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/rainbow
